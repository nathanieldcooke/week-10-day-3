    Phase 3

    Ross demands a refund for the last two coffees that he ordered. (Make sure you delete Ross's coffee orders and not anyone else's. Update his points to reflect the returned purchases.)

        How can I delete his orders without a foreign_key linking a coffee order to his?.. with manually backtracking every order made since then?

    
    Phase 4

    Proof read... but... Nahhh, not doing all that. 
    I do like the theme lol
